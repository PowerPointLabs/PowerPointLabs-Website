**What versions of PowerPoint does PowerPointLabs work with?**
<br />PowerPointLabs supports PowerPoint 2010, 2013 and 2016 on Windows.

**Does PowerPointLabs support Mac Office?**
<br />It does not work for Mac Office at the moment.

**Do I need PowerPointLabs installed when I present?**
<br />Nope! The presentations created with PowerPointLabs can be opened and presented even without the plugin installed - you can display them on other computers without needing to install the plugin on them.

**How do I get new versions of PowerPointLabs?**
<br />You don't need to do a thing; PowerPointLabs will update itself automatically. 

**Will PowerPointLabs work with my templates?**
<br />Definitely! PowerPointLabs works fine with any PowerPoint template.

</p>

<br />Checking the `Maintain Tab Focus` box allows you to remain on the PowerPointLabs Tab after inserting a shape, instead of being transported to the Format Tab in the case of PowerPoint 2013 and 2016. This helps to minimise disruptions to your workflow.

**What if I require technical support?**
<br />Please refer to our [Technical Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/blob/master/doc/TechnicalFAQs.md) for possible solutions to technical issues.
