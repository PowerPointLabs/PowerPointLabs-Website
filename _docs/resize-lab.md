**Resize Lab** helps you to resize objects on a slide in various ways.

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="stretch-and-shrink"></a> Stretch and Shrink
<br/>
<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/streth-and-shrink-1.png" />
</p>

Suppose you want to resize the arrows in the example below,

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/streth-and-shrink-2.png" />
</p>

so that their left edges line up with the left edge of the red arrow as in the example below.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/streth-and-shrink-3.png" />
</p>

To do that, first select the red arrow (i.e. B1.1), followed by the other three arrows, and click the `Left` button. 

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/streth-and-shrink-4.png" />
</p>

In this example the red arrow (B1.1) was used as a reference object to align other objects to because it was the object you selected first.

Instead of using the object selected first as the reference object, you can instruct `Resize Lab` to use the outermost object as the reference object by clicking on the settings   icon on the `STRETCH TO ALIGN` panel, which opens up the dialog given below.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/streth-and-shrink-5.png" />
</p>

When the `Reference Object` is set to `Outermost object` (as shown in the dialog above), if you select the arrows shown below, and click the `Left` button,

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/streth-and-shrink-6.png" />
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/streth-and-shrink-4.png" />
</p>

the result will be as below, irrespective of the order in which you select the arrows.The reason is because the green arrow has the left-most edge and is used as the reference when resizing to the left.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/streth-and-shrink-7.png" />
</p>

Similarly, you can stretch objects to the right, top, and bottom, using the respective buttons, and the results will be as shown in the examples below. 

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/streth-and-shrink-8.png" onload='this.width = 700'/>
</p>

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/streth-and-shrink-9.png" onload='this.width = 700'/>
</p>

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/streth-and-shrink-10.png" onload='this.width = 700'/>
</p>

   
## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="equalize"></a> Equalize
<br/>
<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/equalize-1.png" />
</p>

Suppose you want to equalize the both height and width of the boxes in the example below,

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/equalize-2.png" onload='this.width = 700'/>
</p> 

so that their sizes are the same as the third box’s.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/equalize-3.png" onload='this.width = 700'/>
</p>

To do that, first select the third box, followed by the other three boxes, and click the `Both` button. 

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/equalize-4.png" />
</p>

In this example the second box was used as a reference object to provide dimensions for other objects because it was the object you selected first.

Similarly, you can match either height or width of objects, using the respective buttons, and the results will be as shown below.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/equalize-5.png" onload='this.width = 700'/>
</p>

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="fit-to-slide"></a> Fit To Slide
<br/>

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/fit-to-slide-1.png"/>
</p>

Suppose you want to resize the square in the example below,

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/fit-to-slide-2.png"/>
</p>

so that it fills up the width of the slide.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/fit-to-slide-3.png"/>
</p>

To do that, select the square, and click the `Width` button.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/fit-to-slide-4.png"/>
</p>

You can also resize multiple objects by selecting them before clicking on the button.

Similarly, you can resize objects’ height or both height and width, using the respective buttons, and the results will be as shown below.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/fit-to-slide-5.png" onload='this.width = 700'/>
</p>

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="adjust-slightly"></a> Adjust Slightly
<br/>

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/adjust-slightly-1.png"/>
</p>

Suppose you want to resize the green bar in the example below, so that its height increases precisely by an amount.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/adjust-slightly-2.png"/>
</p>

To do that, select the green bar, and click the `Increase Height` button.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/adjust-slightly-3.png"/>
</p>

To set the amount by which the size increase/decrease, click on the settings   icon on the `ADJUST SLIGHTLY` panel, which opens up the dialog given below.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/adjust-slightly-4.png"/>
</p>

When you increase the value (to 4 in this example), and increase the height of the green bar again, the result will be as below.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/adjust-slightly-5.png"/>
</p>

You can also resize multiple objects by selecting them before clicking on the button.

Similarly, you can increase or decrease objects’ height and width using the respective buttons, and the results will be as shown below.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/adjust-slightly-6.png"/>
</p>

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="match"></a> Match
<br/>

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/match-1.png"/>
</p>

Suppose you want to resize the smiley face below,

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/match-2.png"/>
</p>

so that its height matches its width.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/match-3.png"/>
</p>

To do that, select the shape, and click the `Height to Match Width` button.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/match-4.png"/>
</p>

Similarly, you can also resize the width to match its height instead. Select the shape, and click the `Width to Match Height` button,

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/match-2.png"/>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/match-5.png"/>
</p>

and you will get the following.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/match-6.png"/>
</p>

You can also resize multiple objects by selecting them before clicking on the button.

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="adjust-proportionally"></a> Adjust Proportionally
<br/>

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/adjust-proportionally-1.png"/>
</p>

Suppose you want to have three giraffe images so that their relative heights match the ratio 1980 : 2870 : 3911, as shown below.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/adjust-proportionally-2.png"/>
</p>

To do that, first select the first giraffe, followed by the second and third giraffe, and click the `Height` button.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/adjust-proportionally-3.png"/>
</p>

This will open up a dialog box as shown below.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/adjust-proportionally-4.png"/>
</p>

Enter the respective proportions, and click OK. 

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/adjust-proportionally-5.png"/>
</p>

The objects will be resized accordingly. In this example the first giraffe was used as a reference object to resize other objects because it was the object you selected first. The reference object will not be resized. The second giraffe’s height is increased by about 1.4 (i.e. 2870/1980) times, while the third giraffe’s height is increased by about 2 (i.e. 3911/1980) times. This is because proportions entered for non reference objects (second selected objects onwards) will have their dimensions resized based on the dimension of the reference object. In other words, entering ‘1’ for the reference object and ‘2’ for a non reference object is equivalent to entering ‘3’ and ‘6’ respectively. 

Similarly, you can resize width or area of the objects proportionally using the `Width` or `Area` button respectively.

> **Note:** Adjust area proportionally does not work for grouped objects and objects of different type or shape.

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="main-settings"></a> Main Settings

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/main-settings-1.png"/>
</p>

#### <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="aspect-ratio"></a> Aspect Ratio

`Maintain Aspect Ratio` allows you to lock the aspect ratio of objects if you want to resize objects’ height and width proportionally to its original size. When this option is checked, all resize functions within Resize Lab and PowerPoint will resize objects proportionally.

The following example shows how the setting affects an image’s width being increased.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/aspect-ratio-1.png"/>
</p>

> **Note:** Aspect ratio will not be locked for objects that are being resized using `Equalize Both` and `Match`.

#### <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="anchor-point"></a> Anchor Point

Suppose you are trying to make the orange door in the shape below to be the same size as the blue door. As you know, you can use the `Both` button in the `EQUALIZE` panel here.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/anchor-point-1.png"/>
</p>

However, applying that feature could give you the result given on the left below when you were aiming for the result on the right: while you have the right size for the orange door, the shape ended up in a position different from where you wanted it to.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/anchor-point-2.png"/>
</p>

The `Anchor Point` setting will help you to get the intended result above. It allows you to specify which point of an object you want to stay ‘anchored’ to the slide (i.e. the point that should not move during resizing) when Resize Lab resizes it. There are nine points you can anchor -- an object’s top left, top, top right, left, center, right, bottom left, bottom and bottom right.

The following illustration shows how each anchor point setting affects the resizing of a square object.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/anchor-point-3.png" width="700"/>
</p>

> **Note:** Anchor Point is not applicable to `Stretch/Shrink`.

#### <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="resize-type"></a> Resize Type

Suppose you have the following rotated arrow:

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/resize-type-1.png" />
</p>

Visual height, as the name implies, can be defined as the height which spans from the bottommost point to the topmost point of the shape. Actual height on the other hand, will be the height of the bounding box (i.e. the rectangle surrounding the shape when it is selected), or the height of the shape when it is not rotated. The figure below shows the actual height of the arrow when it is rotated at various angles.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/resize-type-2.png" />
</p>

This applies to visual and actual width as well.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/resize-type-3.png" />
</p>

There are two ways objects can be resized - using an object’s visual dimensions, or its actual height/width. 

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/resize-type-4.png" />
</p>

The example above shows four rotated arrows being resized using `Increase width` and right anchor point. Notice how the `Visual Dimensions` option expands the arrows horizontally while the `Actual Height/Width` option expands them along their rotated angles. You will also notice that anchor points appear to work differently in both options. The red circles in the examples below denote the anchor points used when resizing the arrows.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/resize-type-5.png" />
</p>

In the example above, notice that the anchor point is at the back of the arrow in `Actual Height/Width`. This is because the back of the arrow is in fact, the right side when it is not rotated, as shown below.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/resize-type-6.png" />
</p>

This causes the arrow to grow towards the left side of the arrow, which is the arrowhead, when `Increase Width` is used. On the other hand, the anchor point is on the point where we perceive the right part of the arrow to be, in `Visual Dimensions`. The arrow expands towards the left in this case.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/resize-type-7.png" />
</p>

Likewise, when left anchor point is used in the above example, the anchor point is at the arrowhead in `Actual Height/Width`, as it corresponds to the left side of the arrow when it is not rotated.  Because of this, the arrow grows towards the back part of the arrow, which is the right side of the arrow. Again in `Visual Dimensions`, the arrow simply expands towards the right as the left portion of the arrow is anchored.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/resize-type-8.png" />
</p>

In the next example (given above) the `Visual` option gives a better result. In this example, `Decrease Height` was used to resize the yellow shape using the center anchor point. Note that when the `Visual Dimensions` option is used, the height decreases vertically whereas when using the `actual height/width`, the height decreases at the rotated angle. The example below shows the yellow shape being resized using `Actual Height/Width`.

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/resize-lab/resize-type-9.png" />
</p>

> **Note:** Resizing using visual height/width will result in some of the shape’s properties to be lost. This may result in text within rotated shapes to be displayed in its unrotated position. Resizing with visual height/width is not applicable to `Adjust Area Proportionally`. Resizing with actual height/width is not applicable to `Stretch/Shrink` and `Fit To Slide`.

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="previewing-results"></a> Previewing results
<br/>

You can preview the result of a Resize Lab function by hovering over the respective button while pressing the `Shift` key. 

> **Note:** Previewing is not available for the `Adjust Proportionally` feature.
