The **Effects Lab** makes it easy to draw attention to portions of the slide through blur, color, or magnification effects, and also provides a convenient way to access several of PowerPoint's built-in image effects.

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="make-transparent"></a> Make Transparent

As its name implies, Make Transparent turns the selected image or shape slightly transparent. This can be used to fade an image for use in the background of a slide - something which can't ordinarily be easily done in PowerPoint itself - or to use a shape as an overlay to draw attention to a part of the slide.

For example, we'd like to use this image as the background for the title slide; as is, though, there isn't enough contrast between it and the title.

<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-1.png">

To turn an image or shape transparent, select it, then click `Make Transparent` from the Effects Lab dropdown.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-2.png" width="200">

This turns the image slightly transparent, increasing the contrast between it and the slide's text.

<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-3.png">

> **Note:** the transparency of the image or shape can be adjusted afterwards by right-clicking the image/shape and selecting `Format Shape`.

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="magnifying-glass"></a> Magnifying Glass

The Magnifying Glass effect can be used to enlarge a small detail on the slide. To use it, first draw a shape over the area to be magnified.

> **Note:** though the example shown here uses a circle, any type of shape can be used as the magnifier.

<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-4.png" width="200">

Select the shape, then click `Magnifying Glass` from the Effects Lab dropdown.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-5.png" width="200">

This magnifies the area covered by the shape:

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="spotlight"></a> Spotlight 
<small>[[Sample Slides]]({{ site.baseurl }}/samples/spotlight%20sample.pptx)</small>

**Spotlight** darkens all but a specified region on the slide, allowing you to easily focus your audience's attention on a particular aspect.

Using Spotlight is easy. First, draw a shape to indicate the area which should be lit up - you can use any of PowerPoint's included shapes, or even draw a freeform shape.

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/spotlight-lab-2.png">
</p>

To produce the example shown above, we drew a shape like so:

<p>
  <img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/spotlight-lab-3.png">
</p>

With the shape selected (by clicking once on it), go to the <code>PowerPointLabs</code> tab on the Office Ribbon and click <code>Create Spotlight</code>. 

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/spotlight-lab-4.png" width="200">
</p>

And that's it! PowerPointLabs will create a new slide with the spotlight effect on it.

If you'd like, you can adjust the transparency of the darkened area and the softness of the spotlight's edges from the same tab. Just click the options button here:

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/spotlight-lab-5.png" width="200">
</p>

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/spotlight-lab-6.png" width="350">
</p>

If you're not quite happy with the way things turned out, simply adjust the settings from the dialog (shown above), delete the slide with the spotlight effect, and click `Create Spotlight` again.

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="blur-selected"></a> Blur Selected

Blur Selected can be used to create a frosted glass effect by adding a blur effect to the selected area.

To use it, first draw a shape over the area to be blurred.

<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-15.png">

Select the shape, then select `Blur Selected` from the Effects Lab dropdown and choose the blurriness level to use - in our example here, we chose 90% Blurriness.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-16.png" width="400">

This blurs the area covered by the shape:

<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-17.png">

> **Note:** Blur Selected can also be used on text boxes.

### <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="custom-blurriness"></a> Custom Blurriness

If you want to use a different blurriness level from the default variations, you can select `Settings` under the desired Blur feature in the Effects Lab dropdown.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-20.png" width="400">

In the dialog box, enter your desired blurriness level between 1% and 100%. You can also choose to check the tint option.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-21.png" width="350">

### <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="tint-option"></a> Tint Option

Blur features can create a tinted effect when applying the blur effect. When this option is checked, the respective feature will insert an overlay shape over the blurred shape.

To check this option, select your desired Blur feature from the Effects Lab dropdown and select `Settings` and check `Tint Selected` - in our example here, we checked `Tint Selected` for `Blur Selected` feature. Apply the respective feature and the tinted effect will be created.

<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-19.png">

> **Tip:** To adjust the tint color and transparency, right-click on the overlay shape and select `Format Shape`.

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="blur-remainder"></a> Blur Remainder

Blur Remainder is best used to draw attention to a particular part of the slide by adding a blur effect to the surrounding areas - similar to adjusting the focus on a camera.

To use it, first draw a shape over the area to be kept in focus.

<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-7.png">

Select the shape, then select `Blur Remainder` from the Effects Lab dropdown and choose the blurriness level to use - in our example here, we chose 70% Blurriness.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-8.png" width="400">

PowerPointLabs will then insert a new slide containing the blur effect.

<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-9.png">


## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="recolor-remainder"></a> Recolor Remainder

Recolor Remainder works in a similar manner to Blur Remainder, but instead changes the color of the surrounding areas while leaving the focused area unchanged.

First draw a shape over the area which should be left unchanged.

<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-7.png">

Next, select the shape, select `Recolor Remainder` from the Effects Lab dropdown, then choose the scheme to use - in our example here, we chose Gray Scale.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-10.png" width="400">

PowerPointLabs will insert a new slide, with the surrounding areas recolored.

<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-11.png">


## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="blur-recolor-all-except-selected"></a> Blur / Recolor All Except Selected

If you want to draw attention to an individual shapes instead of a section of a slide, you can use **Blur All Except Selected** or **Recolor All Except Selected** instead.

Suppose that your wish to draw attention to the text box in this slide:

<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-13.png">

After selecting the text box, select `Blur All Except Selected` from the Effects Lab dropdown and choose the blurriness level to use - in our example here, we chose 90% Blurriness.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-12.png" width="400">

Notice that everything in the slide will be blurred except for the selected shapes.

<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/effects-lab-14.png">

The procedure and effect are similar for Recolor All Except Selected.
