PowerPointLabs also introduces several useful shortcuts to make tasks easier. Here's an overview of what these are, and how to use them.

## ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/misc-1.png) <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="edit-name"></a> Edit Name
Right-click on any shape, and choose this option in the submenu `PowerPointLabs` to change its name easily. This is especially useful for giving shapes unique names for use with Auto Animate.

## ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/misc-2.png) <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="fit-to-height"></a> Fit to Height
Right-click on an image or a shape, and choose this option in the submenu `PowerPointLabs` to automatically resize it so it fits the height of the slide. This is great for using high-resolution images which are much larger than the slide.

## ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/misc-3.png) <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="fit-to-width"></a> Fit to Width
Just like Fit to Height, but for images which are a bit too wide. Right-click on an image or shape, and choose this option in the submenu `PowerPointLabs` to resize it so it fits the slide's width.

## ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/misc-4.png) <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="quick-properties"></a> Quick Properties
Instead of the usual two-step process of having to right-click and choose `Properties` to bring up the Properties window, just double-click the item instead!

## ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/misc-5.png) <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="convert-to-picture"></a> Convert to Picture
Right-click almost anything and choose this option in the submenu `PowerPointLabs` to convert it into an image on the slide.
This is useful if you want to apply PowerPoint's artistic effects or color adjustments to an object, or resize an object containing text while maintaining the text's relative size.
