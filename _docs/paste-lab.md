## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="paste-at-cursor-position"></a> Paste At Cursor Position

When you paste an object on the slide, it is often not at the position where you want it. **Paste At Cursor Position** allows you to paste your copied objects at a specified position on your slide. 

With a text, shape or picture copied, `right-click` the desired position on the slide which you would like to paste at, and select `Paste At Cursor Position` under PowerPointLabs.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/paste-lab/image_5.png" width="700">

Your copied objects are now pasted on the slide, with their top-left corners aligned to the position of your right-click.

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="paste-at-original-position"></a> Paste At Original Position

When you paste an object on the slide, its position may be slightly shifted if the original object is at the same position on the slide. **Paste At Original Position** pastes objects at their positions on the slide exactly where they were copied.

After copying a text, shape or picture, `right-click` on an empty area of the slide, and select `Paste At Original Position` under PowerPointLabs.

Your copied objects are now pasted at their original positions. One scenario where this feature is useful is to duplicate arrows such that they start or end at the same position.

> **Note:** If your object is copied from an external application or from your desktop, Paste At Original Position will paste them at the center of the slide.

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="paste-into-group"></a> Paste Into Group

**Paste Into Group** pastes your copied objects into center of your selected group, while preserving the group’s animations.

With an object copied, select a group on the slide which you would like to paste into.

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="replace-with-clipboard"></a> Replace With Clipboard

**Replace With Clipboard** replaces a text, shape or picture on the slide with your copied object, while preserving the original object’s animations. 

You can also replace a single object in a group, which will leave the group’s animations unchanged.

With an object copied, `right-click` on a text, shape or picture on the slide which you would like to replace, and select `Replace With Clipboard` under PowerPointLabs.
