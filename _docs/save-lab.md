Save Presentation allows you to select any number of slides in your current presentation and save them as a new presentation. This comes in handy when you want need a quick way to store selected information from your presentations, e.g. when you need to quickly save and then send a subset of your slides to a co-worker.

Save Lab also remembers where you want to save your presentations, so you can input your preferred storage location once, and subsequently save all presentations easily to your desired directory.

The default storage location is specified under `Settings`. Simply click on `Settings` in the Save dropdown menu, and then on the ***Load*** icon to select your preferred storage location. After selecting, press `OK` to confirm.
