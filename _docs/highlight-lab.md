**Highlight Lab** can be used to easily emphasise individual bullet points or segments of text on a slide, allowing points to stand out in turn as you present them. This can be done in Four different ways: **Spotlight**, **Highlight Points**, **Highlight Background**, and **Highlight Text**.

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="highlight-points"></a> Highlight Points
**Highlight Points** can be used when a more subtle approach is desired, and adjusts only the color of each bullet point.

<p>

</p>

To apply the effect to a slide, select the points to be highlighted, then click the `Highlight Points` button on the PowerPointLabs ribbon.

</p>

During the presentation, each bullet point will then be highlighted after a corresponding click, allowing you to go through them point-by-point.

> **Note:** if there are multiple text boxes on the slide with bullet points in them, the order in which the text boxes appear in PowerPoint's [selection pane](http://www.ellenfinkelstein.com/pptblog/the-wonderful-selection-pane-lets-you-easily-hide-objects-select-them-and-even-rename-them/) will be the order in which they will be highlighted.

> If you'd like to specify a different ordering, simply `ctrl-click` the text boxes in the desired order, then click `Highlight Text`.

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="highlight-background"></a> Highlight Background
**Highlight Background** can be used when you want a flashier way of emphasis, and provides an effect similar to that of a real highlighter on paper.

</p>

To apply this effect to a slide with bullet points on it, select the points to be highlighted, then click `Highlight Background` on the PowerPointLabs ribbon.

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/highlight-lab-background-2.png" width="200">
</p>

When the presentation is running, each bullet point will be highlighted after a corresponding click.

> **Note:** just as with Highlight Points, multiple text boxes will be highlighted in the order in which they appear in the selection pane.

> To override this ordering, just `ctrl-click` the text boxes in the order they should be highlighted in, then click `Highlight Background`.

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="highlight-text"></a> Highlight Text
**Highlight Text** can be used if you'd like to emphasize a smaller section of text anywhere on the slide.

<p>
  <img class="box-shadow slide" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/highlight-lab-text-1.gif">
</p>

To apply this effect, select the text to highlight, then click `Highlight Text` on the PowerPointLabs ribbon.

<p>

</p>

During the presentation, each text fragment will be highlighted after a corresponding click.

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="custom-colors"></a> Custom Colors
The colors used by Highlight Bullets can be customized by opening the settings dialog from the ribbon:

</p>

The `Text Highlight Color` is the color used by Highlight Text to emphasise the current point. After the highlight moves on to the next point, the `Text Default Color` is applied to the previously-highlighted point.

The `Background Highlight Color` is the color used by Highlight Background when applying the "highlighter effect" to a point.

> **Tip:** though the `Text Default Color` is usually the "normal" color used for text on the slide, changing it to a more subtle shade can be used to further emphasise that focus has moved on.
