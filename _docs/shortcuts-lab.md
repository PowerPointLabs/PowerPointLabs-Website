PowerPointLabs also introduces several useful shortcuts to make tasks easier. Here's an overview of what these are, and how to use them.

## <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/shortcuts-lab/image_0.png" width="44"> Quick Properties

Instead of the usual two-step process of having to right-click and choose Properties to bring up the Properties window, just double-click the item instead!

## <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/shortcuts-lab/image_1.png" width="44"> Edit Name

Right-click on any shape, and choose this option in the submenu `PowerPointLabs` to change its name easily. This is especially useful for giving shapes unique names for use with Animation Lab.

## <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/shortcuts-lab/image_4.png" width="44"> Convert To Picture

Right-click almost anything and choose this option in the submenu `PowerPointLabs` to convert it into an image on the slide. This is useful if you want to apply PowerPoint's artistic effects or color adjustments to an object, or resize an object containing text while maintaining the text's relative size.

## <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/shortcuts-lab/image_6.png" width="44"> Hide The Shape

Right-click any object and choose this option in the submenu `PowerPointLabs` to hide it on the slide and slide show. You can unhide it by clicking on it in the PowerPoint’s Selection Pane.

## <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/shortcuts-lab/image_5.png" width="44"> Add Into Group

Add an object into a group while preserving the group’s animations. First, select the group which you would like to add into, then ctrl-click to select the other objects which you would like to add. Right-click on your selections, and choose this option in the submenu `PowerPointLabs` to add them into the group.

## <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/shortcuts-lab/image_7.png" width="44"> Fill Slide

Fills any image(s) to the slide while maintaining aspect ratio. Any area that exceeds the slide boundaries are automatically cropped. First, select any image(s), then right-click on your selection, and choose this option in the submenu `PowerPointLabs` to make your selection fill the slide.
