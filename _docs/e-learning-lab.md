**E-Learning Lab** (*eLL* for short) enables you to add *supplementary explanations* (*explanations* for short) to PowerPoint slides. An explanation item can have the following elements:

* A synthesized audio explanation: eLL uses text-to-speech techniques to generate an audio explanation from the text you provide i.e. there is no need to record your own voice.

* A caption: a text explanation that is placed at the bottom of the slide

* A callout: a text explanation that is placed near the element in the slide that being explained

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/e-learning-lab/image_0.png" width="400">
</p>

Adding such explanations to slides is particularly useful when creating e-Learning resources from slides e.g., self-study slides or e-Learning videos.

* Here is an example self-study slide deck that has such explanations.

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="adding-explanations"></a> Adding explanations

To learn how to use eLL, let us walk through a scenario of adding explanations to a slide. Suppose you have a slide like this (see screenshot below) that has a list of bullet points that appear one after the other and you want to add explanations to each bullet point. 

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/e-learning-lab/image_1.png" width="500">
</p>

First, open the eLL by clicking on the `E-Learning` button on PowerPointLabs ribbon.

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/e-learning-lab/image_2.png" width="250">
</p>

You should see something like this.

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/e-learning-lab/image_3.png" width="500" style="border:2px solid black">
</p>

The items you see in the eLL task pane are animations that already exists in the slide (i.e., those used to animate the three bullet points). The number on each item corresponds to the click number under which the animation should appear e.g., the first bullet point appears after the first click.

To add an explanation to the first bullet point, right click on the first item in the eLL task pane and select `Add Explanation Below`

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/e-learning-lab/image_4.png" width="500" style="border:2px solid black">
</p>

An empty explanation item will be created below the item numbered 1. 

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/e-learning-lab/image_5.png" width="500" style="border:2px solid black">
</p>

Type some text into the empty textbox and tick the `Callout`, `Caption` and `Voice` checkboxes.

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/e-learning-lab/image_6.png" width="500">
</p>

Next, click on the `Sync` button on the top of eLL task pane to synchronize the new explanation we added with the slide.

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/e-learning-lab/image_7.png">
</p>

You will notice that a callout, a caption and an audio has been added to the slide and corresponding animations have been created on PowerPointâ€™s `Animation Pane`. Note that callout is added to a random location in the slide; you can move/resize it as you wish.

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/e-learning-lab/image_8.png" width="800" style="border:2px solid black">
</p>
Now, try playing the slide in presentation mode and observe how the explanation appears together with the first bullet point.

**Congratulations! You have just added an explanation to your slide!**

You can similarly add explanations to the remaining bullet points, or attach an explanation to any animation step in any slide.

> **Note:**

> You can add multiple explanations to a slide without syncing after each addition. But you should `sync` before moving onto a different slide.

> To change the words of a caption/callout/audio, simply edit the corresponding text in the eLL task pane and `sync`. If you edit the text in the callout/caption shapes, those changes will be lost when you sync the next time.

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="other-features"></a> Other Features

###<a class="anchor-bookmark" id="customize-appearance"></a> Customizing the appearance of explanations

By default, callouts and captions have the following appearances:

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/e-learning-lab/image_9.png" width="400">
</p>

You are free to customize them in any way (e.g., change font size/color) and eLL will try to preserve those formattings at subsequent updates to the callout/caption.

Not only that, if you customize an existing callout/caption format on a slide, the same format will be automatically copied over to all subsequent callouts/captions you add to that slide.

### <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="add-more-voice-options"></a> Adding more voice options

By default, eLL uses text-to-speech voices that comes with your Windows. However, it is possible to use the following additional voice options in eLL.

* Microsoft Azure Speech services -- refer to the <a href="#create-azure-account">Adding Microsoft Azure Speech Services</a> for instructions. 

* IBM Watson Speech Services -- refer to the <a href="#create-ibm-account">Adding IBM Watson Speech Services</a> for instructions. 

## <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="eLL-ui"></a> User Interface 

### <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="eLL-task-pane"></a> E-Learning Lab Task Pane

The main UI of eLL is shown below. 

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/e-learning-lab/image_10.png" width="500" style="border:2px solid black">
</p>

There are two types of items on eLL. Normal item is a group of regular animations that cluster under the same click number on the animation pane. An example custom item has the following UI:

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/e-learning-lab/image_11.png" width="500" style="border:2px solid black">
</p>

Custom items are shown for reference only. You will not be able to add/edit them using the eLL. They should be managed using the normal PowerPoint features. 

The main job of the eLL task pane is to help you manage explanation items. An example is shown below:

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/e-learning-lab/image_12.png" width="600">
</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. **Animation trigger**: Use this to control when the explanation will appear. 

* `On Click`: The explanation appears upon a click by the user

* `With Previous`: The explanation item appears together with the item that is above it in the eLL task pane.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. **Callout checkbox**: Tick the callout checkbox to create a callout for this explanation.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. **Caption checkbox**: Tick the caption checkbox to create a caption for this explanation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. **Voice checkbox**: Tick the voice checkbox to create audio for this explanation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. **Audio preview button**: Click on this button to open `Audio Preview Window` as shown below which allows you to:

* Preview different voices for the same text

* Select the best voice for the explanation item

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/e-learning-lab/image_13.png" width="400">
</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To preview the audio for a preferred voice, click the `speak` button next to it. To preview other voices, select the voice (using &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the radio button and drop-downs) and click on `speak` button at the bottom. Click `OK` to confirm you selection.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f. **Caption textbox**: Type your text for callout/caption here.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g. **Use a different text for the callout**: Tick this checkbox if you want callout to have a different text from the caption/audio. <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you tick it, another text box will appear for you to fill in the text for the caption.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h. **Move down button**: Use this button to move the explanation down in the animation order.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. **Delete button**: Use this button to delete the explanation item.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j. **Move up button**: Use this button to move up the explanation button up in the animation order.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;k. **Click number label**: Indicates the click number for the explanation item.

* If an explanation item has trigger type `With Previous`, then it will not have any click number as it will be attached to the click of an item above it. 

* If the explanation item has none of the three types  `Callout`, `Caption` and `Voice` are ticked, the click number will appear as a grey circle (example given below).

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/e-learning-lab/image_14.png" width="500">
