**Spotlight** darkens all but a specified region on the slide, allowing you to easily focus your audience's attention on a particular aspect.

Using Spotlight is easy. First, draw a shape to indicate the area which should be lit up - you can use any of PowerPoint's included shapes, or even draw a freeform shape.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/spotlight-lab-2.png)

To produce the example shown above, we drew a shape like so:

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/spotlight-lab-3.png" />
</p>

With the shape selected (by clicking once on it), go to the <code>PowerPointLabs</code> tab on the Office Ribbon and click <code>Create Spotlight</code>. 

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/spotlight-lab-4.png" />
</p>

And that's it! PowerPointLabs will create a new slide with the spotlight effect on it.

If you'd like, you can adjust the transparency of the darkened area and the softness of the spotlight's edges from the same tab. Just click the options button here:

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/spotlight-lab-5.png" />
</p>

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/docs/spotlight-lab-6.png" />
</p>

If you're not quite happy with the way things turned out, simply adjust the settings from the dialog (shown above), delete the slide with the spotlight effect, and click `Create Spotlight` again.
