The **Effects Lab** makes it easy to draw attention to portions of the slide through blur, color, or magnification effects, and also provides a convenient way to access several of PowerPoint's built-in image effects.

### Make Transparent

As its name implies, Make Transparent turns the selected image or shape slightly transparent. This can be used to fade an image for use in the background of a slide - something which can't ordinarily be easily done in PowerPoint itself - or to use a shape as an overlay to draw attention to a part of the slide.

For example, we'd like to use this image as the background for the title slide; as is, though, there isn't enough contrast between it and the title.

<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/effects-lab-1.png">

To turn an image or shape transparent, select it, then click `Make Transparent` from the Effects Lab dropdown.

<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/effects-lab-2.png">

This turns the image slightly transparent, increasing the contrast between it and the slide's text.

> **Note:** the transparency of the image or shape can be adjusted afterwards by right-clicking the image/shape and selecting `Format Shape`.

### Magnifying Glass

The Magnifying Glass effect can be used to enlarge a small detail on the slide. To use it, first draw a shape over the area to be magnified.

> **Note:** though the example shown here uses a circle, any type of shape can be used as the magnifier.

Select the shape, then click `Magnifying Glass` from the Effects Lab dropdown.

<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/effects-lab-5.png">

This magnifies the area covered by the shape:

### Blur Selected

Blur Selected can be used to create a frosted glass effect. To use it, first draw a shape over the area to be blurred.

<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/effects-lab-15.png">

Select the shape, then click `Blur Selected` from the Effects Lab dropdown.

<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/effects-lab-16.png">

This blurs the area covered by the shape:

### Blur Remainder

Blur Remainder is best used to draw attention to a particular part of the slide by adding a blur effect to the surrounding areas - similar to adjusting the focus on a camera.

To use it, first draw a shape over the area to be kept in focus.

<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/effects-lab-7.png">

Select the shape, then click `Blur Remainder` from the Effects Lab dropdown.

<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/effects-lab-8.png">

PowerPointLabs will then insert a new slide containing the blur effect.

### Recolor Remainder

Recolor Remainder works in a similar manner to Blur Remainder, but instead changes the color of the surrounding areas while leaving the focused area unchanged.

First draw a shape over the area which should be left unchanged.

Next, select the shape, select `Recolor Remainder` from the Effects Lab dropdown, then choose the scheme to use - in our example here, we chose Gray Scale.

PowerPointLabs will insert a new slide, with the surrounding areas recolored.

### Blur / Recolor All Except Selected

If you want to draw attention to an individual shapes instead of a section of a slide, you can use **Blur All Except Selected** or **Recolor All Except Selected** instead.

Suppose that your wish to draw attention to the text box in this slide:

<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/effects-lab-13.png">

After selecting the text box, select *Blur All Except Selected* from the Effects Lab dropdown.

<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/effects-lab-12.png">

Notice that everything in the slide will be blurred except for the selected shapes.

<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/effects-lab-14.png">

The procedure and effect are similar for Recolor All Except Selected.
