**Highlight Lab** can be used to easily emphasise individual bullet points or segments of text on a slide, allowing points to stand out in turn as you present them. This can be done in Four different ways: **Spotlight**, **Highlight Points**, **Highlight Background**, and **Highlight Text**.

###<a class="anchor-bookmark" id="spotlight-lab"></a> Spotlight <small> [[Sample Slides]](./samples/spotlight%20sample.pptx) </small>

**Spotlight** darkens all but a specified region on the slide, allowing you to easily focus your audience's attention on a particular aspect.

Using Spotlight is easy. First, draw a shape to indicate the area which should be lit up - you can use any of PowerPoint's included shapes, or even draw a freeform shape.

![](./img/docs/spotlight-lab-2.png)

To produce the example shown above, we drew a shape like so:

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/spotlight-lab-3.png" />
</p>

With the shape selected (by clicking once on it), go to the <code>PowerPointLabs</code> tab on the Office Ribbon and click <code>Create Spotlight</code>. 

<p>

</p>

And that's it! PowerPointLabs will create a new slide with the spotlight effect on it.

If you'd like, you can adjust the transparency of the darkened area and the softness of the spotlight's edges from the same tab. Just click the options button here:

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/spotlight-lab-5.png" />
</p>

<p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/spotlight-lab-6.png" />
</p>

If you're not quite happy with the way things turned out, simply adjust the settings from the dialog (shown above), delete the slide with the spotlight effect, and click `Create Spotlight` again.

###<a class="anchor-bookmark" id="highlight-point"></a> Highlight Points
**Highlight Points** can be used when a more subtle approach is desired, and adjusts only the color of each bullet point.

<p>
	<img class="box-shadow slide" src="./img/docs/highlight-lab-points-1.gif">
</p>

To apply the effect to a slide, select the points to be highlighted, then click the `Highlight Points` button on the PowerPointLabs ribbon.

<p>
	<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/highlight-lab-points-2.png">
</p>

During the presentation, each bullet point will then be highlighted after a corresponding click, allowing you to go through them point-by-point.

> **Note:** if there are multiple text boxes on the slide with bullet points in them, the order in which the text boxes appear in PowerPoint's [selection pane](http://www.ellenfinkelstein.com/pptblog/the-wonderful-selection-pane-lets-you-easily-hide-objects-select-them-and-even-rename-them/) will be the order in which they will be highlighted.

>If you'd like to specify a different ordering, simply `Ctrl+click` the text boxes in the desired order, then click `Highlight Text`.

###Highlight Background
**Highlight Background** can be used when you want a flashier way of emphasis, and provides an effect similar to that of a real highlighter on paper.

<p>
	<img class="box-shadow slide" src="./img/docs/highlight-lab-background-1.gif">
</p>

To apply this effect to a slide with bullet points on it, select the points to be highlighted, then click `Highlight Background` on the PowerPointLabs ribbon.

<p>
	<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/highlight-lab-background-2.png">
</p>

When the presentation is running, each bullet point will be highlighted after a corresponding click.

> **Note:** just as with Highlight Points, multiple text boxes will be highlighted in the order in which they appear in the selection pane.

> To override this ordering, just `Ctrl+click` the text boxes in the order they should be highlighted in, then click `Highlight Background`.

###Highlight Text
**Highlight Text** can be used if you'd like to emphasize a smaller section of text anywhere on the slide.

<p>
	 <img class="box-shadow slide" src="./img/docs/highlight-lab-text-1.gif">
</p>

To apply this effect, select the text to highlight, then click `Highlight Text` on the PowerPointLabs ribbon.

<p>
	<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/highlight-lab-text-2.png">
</p>

During the presentation, each text fragment will be highlighted after a corresponding click.

###Custom Colors
The colors used by Highlight Lab can be customized by opening the settings dialog from the ribbon:

<p>
	<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/highlight-lab-bullets-1.png">
</p>

<p>
	<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/highlight-lab-bullets-2.png">
</p>

The `Text Highlight Color` is the color used by Highlight Text to emphasise the current point. After the highlight moves on to the next point, the `Text Default Color` is applied to the previously-highlighted point.

The `Background Highlight Color` is the color used by Highlight Background when applying the "highlighter effect" to a point.

> **Tip:** though the `Text Default Color` is usually the "normal" color used for text on the slide, changing it to a more subtle shade can be used to further emphasise that focus has moved on.
