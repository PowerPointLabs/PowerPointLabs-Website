**Auto Crop** allows you to easily cut out a section of an image on a slide without needing any additional image editing software.

First, use the freeform shape tool to mark out the area you'd like to crop.

<p>
  <img class="box-shadow slide" src="./img/docs/auto-crop-2.png">
</p>

Select the shape, then click the `Crop To Shape` button on the ribbon.

<p>
  <img class="box-shadow slide" src="./img/docs/auto-crop-4.png">
</p>


PowerPoint's *shadow* and *soft edges* effects can be used to enhance the look of the cropped image - for instance, here's the same image above after *soft edges* were applied.

<p>
  <img class="box-shadow slide" src="./img/docs/auto-crop-5.png">
</p>

For more complex cut-outs, just draw multiple shapes, select all of them, then click `Crop To Shape`.

<p>
  <img class="box-shadow slide" src="./img/docs/auto-crop-6.png">
</p>

The result of the above crop, with the *shadow* effect applied:

<p>
  <img class="box-shadow slide" src="./img/docs/auto-crop-7.png">
</p>

> **Note:** Auto Crop can also be used to cut an area from multiple images. Just draw the shape(s) over all the images, select them, and click the `Crop To Shape` button.
